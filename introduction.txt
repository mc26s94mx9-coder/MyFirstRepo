# Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Steven Mucyo. I am currently studying Human Nutrition and Dietetics at the University of Rwanda. I am passionate about improving health in my community through nutrition education and better dietary practices.

I am learning Git and GitHub to grow my digital skills and prepare myself for future opportunities in research, technology, and academic work.
